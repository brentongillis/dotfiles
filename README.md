## dotfiles

My current dotfiles.

Nothing special here.

###### Autoformatter
For the autoformatter to work, the system needs to have the following:
* astyle - `# sudo pacman -S astyle`
* js-beautify - `# sudo npm install -g js-beautify`

For the rest of the plugin usage, check out the .vimrc. I'm slowly moving away from
Sublime Text 3 to using Vim exclusively everywhere, so it is a work in progress.
